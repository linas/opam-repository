(** OPAM (OCaml Package Manager) module for CogUtil *)
(** *)
(** This is in the root directory because I cannot figure out *)
(** how to tell opam to look for it somewhere else. Sigh. *)
(** *)
(** To build, say: `sudo ls -la` and provide your password. *)
(** Then say `opam install .` in the root git directory. *)
(** I have no clue how to get this to build without the sudo step. *)
(** Finally, say `eval $(opam env)` *)
